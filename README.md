# vimrc
Repo for the all important .vimrc file

This .vimrc file uses vundle, nerdtree, ctrlp, and a solarized colorscheme
Once Vundle is set up, running ':PluginInstall' will install nerdtree and
ctrlp. The solarized colorsheme needs to be installed on its own.

TODO: 
- See if solarized scheme can be added as plugin
- Make install script
